1. debug nvim startup time
2. nvim - finally learn using multiple buffers instead of using TMUX for that
3. vimb <-> zx2c4's password-store integration
4. vimb <-> i3, containers?
5. something for hipchat/slack, web versions suck
6. something for imap mail (Mutt?), webmails suck. AquaMail for android is
perfect.
